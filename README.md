# Boundless Toolkit

This repo contains a set of tools and docs for rapid development of web and mobile applications.

Many of these tools are related, so it's recommended to use the same version for all tools. If you want to upgrade versions, 
be sure to check the release notes to ensure compatibility.

## Development Setup
Run `npm install`

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
